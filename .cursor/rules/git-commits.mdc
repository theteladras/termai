# Git Commit Rules

- NEVER add "Co-authored-by" trailers to commit messages. No co-author lines of any kind.
- Do not modify git config (user.name, user.email, etc.).

## Conventional Commits

All commit messages MUST use a conventional commit prefix:

- `feat:` — new feature or capability
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `refactor:` — code restructuring without behavior change
- `chore:` — maintenance, dependencies, build, config
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `style:` — formatting, whitespace, no logic change
- `test:` — adding or updating tests
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `ci:` — CI/CD changes

Format: `<prefix>: <short description>`

Examples:
- `feat: add AI orchestrator for multi-step task execution`
- `fix: prevent GUI server shutdown on page refresh`
- `chore: bundle openai/anthropic into standalone executable`
- `docs: add roadmap section to README`
- `refactor: rewrite safety module with regex-based rules`
